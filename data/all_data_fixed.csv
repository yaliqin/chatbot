1,"What functions are supported by the tool? Input and context tree modeling,Test case modeling and Test case input modeling. What is test case modeling?","Generating Test Cases based on provided input and the context trees. With this feature, users can generate test cases for all the combination for the respective input and context trees.
"
1,"What functions are supported by the tool? Input and context tree modeling,Test case modeling and Test case input modeling. What is the difference between test case input modeling and input tree modeling?","In Input tree modeling we are defining the factors which need to be considered while testing a certain product.  We use this tree while defining the test case group and to generate the test cases. Test Case Input modeling refers to Data/Input Data required for the test case. In this module, we are providing the user ability to add input data to the test case either manually or with the help of a web search engine.
