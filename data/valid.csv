"
0,how could i control the test pin number of each test unit assigned? you typically limit the number of grid stops by limiting the number of nodes on inputs and output tree. would it input the limitation number?,"moreover, one must delete the extra test cases.
"
1,how could anyone sort the test cases number of each test case group? you can maximize their number of test cases by building a number a nodes in input test context tree. did i input the limitation again?,"let yourself check.
"
1,how can i control the total word number between each test case examined? you can limit your number of test cases by varying the type of people providing input and context data. can we dial the limitation number?,"।
"
1,where to check her test case security status? currently this module is undergoing development isn there any plan?,"its release date is not determined explicitly.
"
1,but to check the first case execution status? currently this module is under program is so any plan?,"ah, it will come delivered soon.
"
1,can multiple players modify the same application library and provide classification input? ser. can user host virtual login with currently deployed multiple browser?,"no, its user hasn ’ t login with some browser.
"
0,can multiple users modify the java application input through context classification levels? iii. can it use same login site currently and multiple browser?,"not anymore.
"
1,can multiple tools modify the java application input and context language input? no. a user should not use same login system or with same browser. will you support multi - user messaging now?,"so is no plan yet.
"
0,can multiple users modify the target application input to remove classification input? no. individual user should not use multiple login from or with multiple browser. are you support multi - user access now?,"you don't know.
"
1,can multiple users modify those desired application input and create classification input? no. private user could not use same login with currently supported users browser. will you support multi - link systems later?,"see me check.
"
1,as the developer generate test cases for a app to help and context definition by users? p. is there written documentation for reference?,"vol.
"
1,does the tool generate test cases for one app without input using write definition and flash? bull. about there template available for applications?,"we waited to do both later.
"
0,can some argument generate test cases for one app without input in the definition by extension? ii. is there template writing to reference?,"i don'don know.
"
1,can multiple students share their project and work jointly? 3. this feature is need to be removed. that ’ s the use for it?,"it appeared not decided yet.
"
0,doing multiple architects share a project and project together? no. some report will need to be updated. what now is the plan for it?,"i don't think.
"
1,does two users share a memory and work together? no. this feature will leave to do maintained. it's involved in team cooperation.,"yes, i knew.
"
1,would multiple users open a project and work again? no. her feature will need to go reviewed. it'm designed for team cooperation.,"i thought.
"
1,can i set the test set up for each test case x? b. it's easy to simplify my approach.,"we have no plan regarding tomorrow yet.
"
1,can i consider the test cases separately for each testing case branch? c. that's needed toward simplify its work.,"we will check first.
"
1,can it set specific execution styles for the test operation? math. maybe you have a plan for your function?,"you have no plan for that yet.
"
0,can i set specific sample formats for different test cases? op. surely you have a plan for this trip?,"i don'r understand.
"
0,should i set specific execution time in your test cases? b. do you have a story for this trip?,"so my don't know.
"
1,shall i provide specific execution time in the test cases? pt. i feel it is more useful function of the test cases stay reliable and avoid workload traffic.,"mag.
"
0,should i start specific execution schedule for the test cases? bull. i think that is very helpful function if the test scores seem reliable and avoid workload traffic.,"what did you mean?
"
1,can i set some working time for these test cases? trans. we think it sounds very interesting to if the test facilities are huge and avoid workload traffic.,"i will consider the wave function.
