No. Currently we do not have this facility.

1	Hello, how can I edit my nodes for input classification? Sure, you can edit or delete nodes. How many nodes can I add at most in one time?	There is a ‘create 5 Nodes’ option to add five child nodes with default names. Then you can select the node to rename with appropriate values.	Sounds great.

Is there an upper limit on the total levels of nodes? 	In Input tree modeling we are defining the factors which need to be considered while testing a certain product.  We use this tree while defining the test case group and to generate the test cases Test Case Input modeling refers to Data/Input Data required for the test case. In this module, we are providing the user ability to add input data to the test case either manually or with the help of a web search engine

1	Hi, I cannot add a child node to the 4th level of the context tree. How can I fix this?	Oh, sorry to inform you that our context tree only supports up to 3 levels of design. I am afraid you have to get rid of the 4th level or simplify your design to 3 levels. 	Ok, got it! I will modify it.	You can modify it offline and then upload the modified file, or modify online in the workspace and save the updated version.

1	How can I organize the context features? Can you provide a template?	You can organize your context features into a tree structure level by level. A parent node presents a context feature, and a child node presents a subfeature of that context feature.	How many subfeatures can I add to a context feature?	There is no limit to the number of subfeatures you can add. But be careful, our context tree design only supports up to 3 levels.
