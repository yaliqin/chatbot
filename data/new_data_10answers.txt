Higher the nodes more no of test cases will be generated.So if possible create trees with key values.	Thanks. Can I use scratching input classification file.Understand

I understand that, but can you provide a little bit more explanation?	The output tree can be auto generated or the user can manually create the tree. User can manipulate this output tree to model the expected output.

1	How can I customize my own context tree?	You can customize your context features by simply changing the labels of nodes, adding or deleting nodes in the context tree.	Great! Do you mean each node represents a context feature?	Yep! Each node in the context tree stands for a context feature you designed. Besides, just let you know, you can enter subnodes as subfeatures as well.

And how many child nodes can each node have?The tree should have only three levels. There is no limit on the number of nodes and child nodes. Higher the nodes more number of test cases will be generated.
